Recursion is a method in programming where a function keeps calling 
itself to solve smaller parts of a bigger problem. This continues 
until it reaches a specific stopping point known as the base case. 
The base case is what prevents the recursion from going on forever.

How recursion helps is that it breaks down a complicated task into 
smaller and more manageable subproblems. This approach is particularly
helpful in situations where the problem involves repetitive patterns 
or steps that can be solved similarly at different levels.

Time Complexity:
The recursive method used to forecast financial values has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' represents the number of years we're forecasting. This is because each recursive call reduces the problem by one year, and each step only performs a small amount of work.

Optimization:
There are better ways to make it more efficient:

Using a loop (iteration):
Instead of calling the function multiple times, we can use a simple loop to multiply the value each year. This reduces the number of function calls and also saves memory.

Using the direct formula:
Another approach is to use the standard compound growth formula:

java
Copy code
Future Value = Initial Value × (1 + Growth Rate)^n
This gives us the result in a single step, without
the need for recursion or even a loop. 
It’s the most efficient method,
especially when dealing with large values of 'n'.
